animatediff refactor, ~~because I can.~~ with significantly lower VRAM usage.

Also, **infinite generation length support!** yay!

# LoRA loading is ABSOLUTELY NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

PRs welcome! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜…

This can theoretically run on CPU, but it's not recommended. Should work fine on a GPU, nVidia or otherwise,
but I haven't tested on non-CUDA hardware. Uses PyTorch 2.0 Scaled-Dot-Product Attention (aka builtin xformers)
by default, but you can pass `--xformers` to force using xformers if you *really* want.

## How to use

I should write some more detailed steps, but here's the gist of it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neggles/animatediff-cli
cd animatediff-cli
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# install Torch. Use whatever your favourite torch version >= 2.0.0 is, but, good luck on non-nVidia...
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# install the rest of all the things (probably! I may have missed some deps.)
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
# you should now be able to
animatediff --help
# There's a nice pretty help screen with a bunch of info that'll print here.
```

From here you'll need to put whatever checkpoint you want to use into `data/models/sd`, copy
one of the prompt configs in `config/prompts`, edit it with your choices of prompt and model (model
paths in prompt .json files are **relative to `data/`**, e.g. `models/sd/vanilla.safetensors`), and
off you go.

Then it's something like (for an 8GB card):
```sh
animatediff generate -c 'config/prompts/waifu.json' -W 576 -H 576 -L 128 -C 16
```
You may have to drop `-C` down to 8 on cards with less than 8GB VRAM, and you can raise it to 20-24
on cards with more. 24 is max.

N.B. generating 128 frames is _**slow...**_

## RiFE!

I have added experimental support for [rife-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan)
using the `animatediff rife interpolate` command. It has fairly self-explanatory help, and it has
been tested on Linux, but I've **no idea** if it'll work on Windows.

Either way, you'll need ffmpeg installed on your system and present in PATH, and you'll need to
download the rife-ncnn-vulkan release for your OS of choice from the GitHub repo (above). Unzip it, and
place the extracted folder at `data/rife/`. You should have a `data/rife/rife-ncnn-vulkan` executable, or `data\rife\rife-ncnn-vulkan.exe` on Windows.

You'll also need to reinstall the repo/package with:
```py
python -m pip install -e '.[rife]'
```
or just install `ffmpeg-python` manually yourself.

Default is to multiply each frame by 8, turning an 8fps animation into a 64fps one, then encode
that to a 60fps WebM. (If you pick GIF mode, it'll be 50fps, because GIFs are cursed and encode
frame durations as 1/100ths of a second).

Seems to work pretty well...

## TODO:

In no particular order:

- [x] Infinite generation length support
- [x] RIFE support for motion interpolation (`rife-ncnn-vulkan` isn't the greatest implementation)
- [x] Export RIFE interpolated frames to a video file (webm, mp4, animated webp, hevc mp4, gif, etc.)
- [x] Generate infinite length animations on a 6-8GB card (at 512x512 with 8-frame context, but hey it'll do)
- [x] Torch SDP Attention (makes xformers optional)
- [x] Support for `clip_skip` in prompt config
- [x] Experimental support for `torch.compile()` (upstream Diffusers bugs slow this down a little but it's still zippy)
- [x] Batch your generations with `--repeat`! (e.g. `--repeat 10` will repeat all your prompts 10 times)
- [x] Call the `animatediff.cli.generate()` function from another Python program without reloading the model every time
- [x] Drag remaining old Diffusers code up to latest (mostly)
- [ ] Add a webUI (maybe, there are people wrapping this already so maybe not?)
- [ ] img2img support (start from an existing image and continue)
- [ ] Stop using custom modules where possible (should be able to use Diffusers for almost all of it)
- [ ] Automatic generate-then-interpolate-with-RIFE mode
